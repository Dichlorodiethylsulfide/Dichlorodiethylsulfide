Hi, I'm Riki Lowe (@Dichlorodiethylsulfide)

I'm interested in numerous scientific topics, ranging from programming to etymology to chemistry.

Though this profile is for my main interest, programming, and how to reach me.

My current programming skills focus primarily on:
- C#
- C/C++
- Python

Though I have interests in any and all programming languages in-between and always ready to learn more about programming in general.

Smaller projects I've built have been in:
- Javascript (with PHP backend and HTML frontend, i.e. a LAN website/server)
- Assembly

I have a multitude of on-going projects as well as knowledge in varying programming/game engines such as:
- Unity (C#)
- Unreal Engine (Unreal C++)

Some of my projects even include creating my own scriping languages and engines.

A game published on my itch.io includes its own language and documentation on how to use it.

In C++, however, I've started building an engine in SFML and although only minimal, I hope to expand it to help develop my own 2D games in my own engine!

I'd be happy to collaborate on projects, making commits, suggesting new ideas, and giving my opinion and knowledge on anything programming related 
and welcome situations that allow me to contribute. I'd love constructive criticism of my work too, so we can all grow together.
